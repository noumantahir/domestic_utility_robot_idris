# domestic_utility_robot_idris

The project was my Final Year Project at Mechatronics Department, NUST. The primary purpose of this robot is to take part in
RoboCup @Home League some day but the scope for us was limited to developing a basic robot that may be further used to fetch
funding and resources so later teams can actually participate in the competition.

We started prototyping with iRobot Create base, a Kinect and a system with Robot Operating Syste aka ROS, there were a set of 
targets we were after and these were achieved

- making the robot follow a person
- accepting a set of verbal commands
- responding through speech narrators
- robotic arm simulation
- basic SLAM implemention (was not integrated in the end)

To achieve these targets a set ROS modules were used along with a combination of our own Alogorithms and Google Services via a
connected Android App developed to work with the robot along with emergency controls
